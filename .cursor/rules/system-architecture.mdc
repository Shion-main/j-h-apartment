# J&H Management System - Architecture & Tech Stack

## Overview
The J&H Management System is a web-based rental property management application designed for J&H Management staff (tenants do NOT have direct access).

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ (React-based web application)
  - React Server Components (RSC) for optimal performance
  - Streaming SSR and Partial Prerendering
  - Edge Runtime for API routes
  - Server Actions for form handling
- **Backend**: Supabase Enterprise
  - Database: PostgreSQL 15+ with Row-Level Security (RLS)
  - Redis caching for high-performance data access
  - Authentication: Supabase Auth with JWT
  - Serverless Functions: Supabase Edge Functions (Deno runtime)
  - Real-time subscriptions for live updates
  - Point-in-time recovery and automated backups
- **Email Service**: Nodemailer within Supabase Edge Functions
- **Currency**: All monetary values in Philippine Pesos (PHP)
- **Performance Features**:
  - HTTP/2 and compression enabled
  - Edge caching for static assets
  - Materialized views for complex queries
  - Cursor-based pagination
  - Optimistic updates for better UX

## Core System Modules
1. **Authentication & Authorization** - User account management with role-based access
2. **Dashboard & Analytics** - Business metrics, financial reporting, audit logs
3. **Branch Management** - Multi-branch operations with default rates
4. **Room Management** - Individual room tracking and occupancy status
5. **Tenant Management** - Move-in, move-out, contract renewal processes
6. **Billing System** - Automated billing cycles with flexible calculations
7. **Payment Processing** - Payment recording with penalty calculations
8. **Company Expenses** - Manual expense tracking and categorization
9. **Email Notifications** - Automated tenant communications
10. **History & Audit** - Comprehensive tracking and audit trails

## Key Business Rules
- **Billing Cycles**: Consistent monthly cycles based on tenant's rent_start_date
- **Contract Terms**: Default 6-month contracts with renewal options
- **Deposit Rules**: Different rules for tenants with 5+ vs 4 or fewer fully paid bills
- **Penalty System**: Configurable penalty percentage (default 5%) for payments more than 10 days after due date
- **Move-Out Process**: Two-phase process with final bill calculation and settlement

## Security Requirements
- HTTPS/SSL encryption for all communications
- Row-Level Security (RLS) implementation
- Environment variables for sensitive data (SMTP credentials)
- Protection against SQL injection and XSS
- Role-based access control
