# J&H Management System - Business Logic Rules

## Tenant Management Business Rules

### Move-In Process
1. **Advance Payment** = Room's monthly rent (PHP)
2. **Security Deposit** = Room's monthly rent (PHP)
3. **Contract Duration** = 6 months from rent_start_date
4. **Initial Setup**: Record initial_electricity_reading, set tenant as active, mark room as occupied

### Move-Out Process (Two-Phase)

#### Phase 1: Calculate Final Balance
- Confirm move_out_date
- Calculate **Final Consolidated Bill**:
  - **Prorated Rent**: (room.monthly_rent ÷ total_days_in_cycle) × days_occupied_in_current_cycle
  - **Electricity Charges**: (present_electricity_reading - previous_reading) × branch.electricity_rate
  - **Water Charges**: Editable amount for final period
  - **Extra Fees**: Editable amount and description
  - **Outstanding Bills**: Sum of all active/partially paid bills
- Apply **Deposit Rules** based on fully paid bill count (5+ bills = both deposits available, 4 or fewer = security deposit forfeited)
- Create final bill with is_final_bill = true
- Send appropriate email (final bill or refund notification)

#### Phase 2: Settlement & Deactivation
- Record payment or refund against final bill
- When final bill reaches 'fully_paid' status:
  - Set tenant.is_active = false
  - Set tenant.room_id = NULL
  - Set room.is_occupied = false

## Billing Calculations

### Billing Cycle Determination
```javascript
// Example: rent_start_date = 2025-03-17
// Cycle 1: 2025-03-17 to 2025-04-16
// Cycle 2: 2025-04-17 to 2025-05-16
// Cycle 3: 2025-05-17 to 2025-06-16
```

### Bill Components
1. **Monthly Rent**: Use room's specific monthly_rent (may differ from branch default)
2. **Electricity**: (present_reading - previous_reading) × branch.electricity_rate
3. **Water**: Fixed branch.water_rate
4. **Extra Fees**: Editable amount + description
5. **Total Before Penalty**: Sum of above
6. **Due Date**: billing_period_end + 10 days

### Penalty System
- **Trigger**: payment_date > due_date AND bill not fully paid
- **Amount**: Configurable percentage (default 5%) of total_amount_due (before penalty)
- **Configuration**: Admins can modify penalty percentage globally via Settings (FR-SETT-002)
- **Application**: Add to total_amount_due, update bill status
- **Note**: Penalty percentage changes affect only FUTURE calculations, not existing bills

### Payment Status Logic
- **Active**: Newly generated, no payments
- **Partially Paid**: 0 < amount_paid < total_amount_due
- **Fully Paid**: amount_paid ≥ total_amount_due
- **Refund**: For final bills where tenant deposit exceeds balance

## Deposit Rules on Move-Out

### Cycle Count Determination
Count bills with status = 'fully_paid' for the tenant

### Rule Application
- **5+ Fully Paid Bills** (6th cycle or beyond): 
  - Available: advance_payment + security_deposit
  - Apply to: outstanding balance
  - Refund: remaining amount if any
- **4 or Fewer Fully Paid Bills** (5th cycle or below):
  - Available: advance_payment only
  - Forfeited: security_deposit (becomes company income)
  - Apply: advance_payment to outstanding balance
  - Refund: remaining advance_payment if any

## Financial Reporting Logic

### Monthly Income Calculation
- **Rent Collected**: Sum of rent payments for the month
- **Electricity Collected**: Sum of electricity payments for the month
- **Water Collected**: Sum of water payments for the month
- **Extra Fees Collected**: Sum of extra fee payments for the month
- **Penalty Fees Collected**: Sum of penalty payments for the month
- **Forfeited Deposits**: Security deposits from tenants with < 6 cycles who moved out

### Monthly Expenses
- Sum of all company_expenses for the selected month

### Profit/Loss
- **Profit/Loss** = Total Monthly Income - Total Monthly Expenses

## Email Trigger Rules

### Automatic Triggers
1. **Welcome Email**: After tenant move-in
2. **Bill Email**: After bill generation
3. **Edited Bill Email**: After bill modification
4. **Partial Payment Email**: After partial payment recording
5. **Full Payment Receipt**: After bill reaches fully_paid status
6. **Final Bill Email**: For move-out with balance due
7. **Refund Notice**: For move-out with refund due
8. **Daily Reminders**: 3 days before billing cycle end for each active tenant

## Audit Requirements

### Mandatory Logging Actions
- User authentication events
- Tenant move-in/move-out
- Bill generation and modifications
- Payment recording
- Settings changes (rates, penalty percentage)
- Company expense CRUD operations

### Critical Value Tracking
For monetary amounts and dates, log both old_values and new_values:
- present_reading_date
- payment_date
- monthly_rent rates
- electricity_rate, water_rate
- **penalty_percentage** (critical for audit - changes affect all future penalty calculations)
- present_electricity_reading
- extra_fee amounts
- payment amounts
- expense amounts
