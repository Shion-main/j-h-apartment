# J&H Management System - Database Design

## Core Entities & Relationships

### Primary Tables
- **branches** - Branch locations with default rates
- **rooms** - Individual rental units within branches
- **tenants** - Tenant information and lease details
- **bills** - Billing records with calculations
- **payments** - Payment transactions against bills
- **company_expenses** - Business expense tracking
- **audit_logs** - System activity tracking

## Key Entity Patterns

### Branches
```sql
- id (PK)
- name (Branch Name)
- address
- monthly_rent_rate (PHP)
- water_rate (PHP)
- electricity_rate (PHP)
- room_number_prefix
```

### Rooms
```sql
- id (PK)
- branch_id (FK)
- room_number
- monthly_rent (PHP, defaults to branch rate)
- is_occupied (boolean)
```

### Tenants
```sql
- id (PK)
- room_id (FK, nullable for moved-out tenants)
- full_name
- phone_number
- email_address
- rent_start_date
- contract_start_date
- contract_end_date
- initial_electricity_reading
- advance_payment (PHP)
- security_deposit (PHP)
- is_active (boolean)
- move_out_date (nullable)
```

### Bills
```sql
- id (PK)
- tenant_id (FK)
- billing_period_start
- billing_period_end
- previous_electricity_reading
- present_electricity_reading
- present_reading_date (editable)
- electricity_consumption
- electricity_amount (PHP)
- water_amount (PHP)
- monthly_rent_amount (PHP)
- extra_fee (PHP)
- extra_fee_description
- penalty_fee (PHP)
- total_amount_due (PHP)
- amount_paid (PHP)
- due_date
- status ('active', 'partially_paid', 'fully_paid', 'refund')
- is_final_bill (boolean)
```

### Payments
```sql
- id (PK)
- bill_id (FK)
- amount_paid (PHP)
- payment_date (editable)
- payment_method ('cash', 'gcash')
- notes
```

### Audit Logs
```sql
- id (PK)
- user_id (FK)
- action
- target_table
- target_id
- old_values (JSON for monetary/date changes)
- new_values (JSON for monetary/date changes)
- timestamp
```

## Critical Business Logic

### Billing Cycle Calculation
- Based on tenant's `rent_start_date`
- Consistent monthly periods (e.g., 3/17 to 4/16, then 4/17 to 5/16)
- Due date = billing_period_end + 10 days

### Penalty Calculation
- Configurable percentage (default 5%) of `total_amount_due` (before penalty)
- Stored in system settings table for global configuration
- Applied when payment_date > due_date
- Only for bills not yet fully paid
- Setting changes affect future penalty calculations only

### Deposit Rules (Move-Out)
- **5+ fully paid bills** (6th cycle or beyond): Both advance payment and security deposit available for outstanding balances
- **4 or fewer fully paid bills** (5th cycle or below): Only advance payment available, security deposit forfeited

### Final Bill Calculation
- Prorated monthly rent based on days occupied
- Final electricity reading and consumption
- Final water charges (editable)
- Extra fees (editable)
- All outstanding bill balances
- Deposit application based on cycle rules
